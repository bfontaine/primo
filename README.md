# Primo HTML Documentation

This is `primo`â€™s HTML documentation. Switch on the [`master`][master] branch
for the source code.

[master]: https://github.com/bfontaine/primo

This code is generated by running `cargo doc --no-deps` on `master`, then
moving everything from `target/doc/*` at top-level.
